Project Summary
The DriverPass project was created for a new company that wanted to help students pass their DMV driving exams by combining online learning, practice tests, and on-the-road lesson scheduling into one easy-to-use platform. As the systems analyst, I developed the business requirements and the full system design to support these goals. The end result included clear documentation, diagrams, and models that show how students, instructors, and administrators interact with the system.

What I Did Well
I think I did particularly well at identifying and defining both the functional and nonfunctional requirements. My documentation clearly explained what the system needed to do and how it should perform. The UML diagrams I created also helped connect the business side of the project to its technical implementation by visually showing how each user and process fits into the overall system.

What I Would Revise
If I were to revise one part of my work, I would focus on simplifying and clarifying my UML diagrams. As a self-developer not actively working in a team setting, I see how important it is to remember the objective of each diagram—especially if it’s meant for a nontechnical audience. A complex diagram that’s hard to read defeats its purpose. Sometimes, writing out a technical document or narrative explanation can communicate ideas more effectively than a heavily detailed visual. Tools like UMLs are powerful, but only when they’re used intentionally and understood by their audience.

Interpreting and Meeting User Needs
Throughout the project, I consistently referred to the DriverPass interview and requirements to ensure that my design addressed real client needs. Every diagram and function was tied back to a specific goal—like giving students more control over scheduling or helping staff reduce manual coordination. Understanding the audience and users is essential; without that perspective, even a technically sound system might not meet expectations.

Approach to Designing Software
My approach to software design emphasizes clarity and communication. While technical diagrams and documentation are valuable, I’ve learned that plain English often serves the broadest purpose. Clear, straightforward language makes technical work accessible to both developers and clients. In the future, I plan to continue combining structured analysis tools like UMLs with well-written documentation and collaboration with teammates to ensure that both technical and nontechnical audiences can fully understand the system being designed.
