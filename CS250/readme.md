How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

In this course, I learned how important it is to translate user needs into user stories with clear acceptance criteria. For example, in the SNHU Travel project, the “Top 10 Destinations” feature was written as a story that emphasized filtering based on user preferences and past experiences. This made it easier to break the work down into smaller testable tasks, and it gave developers, testers, and the Product Owner a common language. When the scope shifted to focus on spa and resort-based locations, having well-structured user stories helped the team quickly adapt without confusion. User stories act as a bridge between what the customer values and what developers actually code.

How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

My approach to development has become much more iterative and adaptive. In this project, backlog refinement, sprint planning, and continuous communication helped the team deliver working features even when requirements changed mid-sprint. For example, testers were able to quickly revise their edge cases when filtering logic changed, because development and testing were integrated into each sprint rather than left for later. Going forward, I hope to incorporate Agile processes such as iterative backlog refinement, continuous integration, and sprint retrospectives into my work. These practices make development more flexible and ensure that feedback is always shaping the next increment.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

A good team member is someone who communicates clearly, collaborates across roles, and keeps the team goal in focus. During the SNHU Travel project, I saw how important it was to raise blockers quickly in daily standups and to clarify acceptance criteria early with the Product Owner. The email example I drafted in week 5 showed me how valuable clear, asynchronous communication can be in keeping work moving. To me, being a good team member also means supporting continuous improvement, whether that’s through contributing ideas in retrospectives or helping teammates with tasks outside your immediate role. Ultimately, success comes from the team delivering value together, not from individuals working in isolation. Being a good team member also comes with accepting and owning your own mistakes.
